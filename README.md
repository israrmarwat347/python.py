# My Python Project
Jenkins Pipeline Setup Guide
Introduction
This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline for automatically pulling the project from GitHub and running a Python script. Below is a guide on how to set up and run the pipeline for your own use.

Prerequisites
Before running the Jenkins pipeline, make sure you have the following:

Jenkins Installed:

Ensure Jenkins is installed and running on your machine or on a server.

If you're new to Jenkins, you can download and install it from the Jenkins official website.

GitHub Repository:

You need to have a GitHub repository with a Python project (like app.py in this case).

Jenkins Plugins:

Ensure that the following Jenkins plugins are installed:

Git plugin (for pulling the repository from GitHub)

Pipeline plugin (for creating and running Jenkins pipelines)

Python:

Make sure Python is installed on the machine running Jenkins. The pipeline uses python3 to run the Python script (app.py).

Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone this Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine or server where Jenkins is installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Step 2: Create a Jenkins Job (Pipeline)
Open Jenkins in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8080).

Click on New Item in the Jenkins dashboard.

Enter a name for the job (e.g., MyPythonPipeline).

Choose Pipeline and click OK.

Under the Pipeline section, set the Definition to Pipeline script.

Paste the following Jenkins pipeline script into the Script area:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        GIT_REPO = 'https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git'  // Replace with your GitHub repo URL
        BRANCH = 'master'  // The branch you want to build (e.g., 'master')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Git') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Checkout the repository from GitHub
                    git branch: "${BRANCH}", url: "${GIT_REPO}"
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Python Script') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run the Python script that was pulled from the repository
                    sh 'python3 app.py'  // Adjust path if needed
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Save the Jenkins job.

Step 3: Set Up GitHub Webhook (Optional)
To automatically trigger the Jenkins job when there is a push to your GitHub repository, set up a webhook on GitHub:

Go to your GitHub repository.

Navigate to Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook.

In the Payload URL, enter your Jenkins server URL (e.g., http://your-jenkins-server.com/github-webhook/).

Set Content type to application/json.

Choose the events you want to trigger the webhook (e.g., Push events).

Click Add webhook.

Step 4: Run the Pipeline
After the setup, you can manually trigger the pipeline by clicking Build Now on the Jenkins job page.

If you set up the webhook, the pipeline will run automatically every time you push changes to your GitHub repository.

Step 5: View the Build Results
To view the results of each build, go to your Jenkins job's page.

Click on the build number to view the console output and details about each build.

Troubleshooting
Jenkins is not triggering on GitHub push:

Double-check the webhook settings in GitHub.

Make sure Jenkins is publicly accessible if it's running on a remote server.

Python script not running:

Ensure Python is installed and available in the system's PATH.

Verify the path to your script is correct (it should be relative to the workspace).

Git repository not found:

Make sure the repository URL and branch name are correct in the pipeline script.

Conclusion
With this Jenkins pipeline, you can automate the process of pulling your code from GitHub and running a Python script. This setup can be extended for more complex workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying your Python applications.
